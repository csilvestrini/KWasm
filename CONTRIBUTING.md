# Contributing 

First of all: all contributors are welcome!

## Code Style

KWasm follows the official Android kotlin [style guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide). 
Among other things: this means indents are 4-spaces, and continuation indents are also 4-spaces (not 8).

## Pull Requests

Please make your PR descriptions detailed, if you're introducing new code - please test it well. 

In addition to all tests passing, at least one approval from a contributor will be required before your 
PR can be merged into `master`.
